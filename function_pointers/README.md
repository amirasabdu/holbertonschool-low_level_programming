# C - Function pointers

Function pointers in C are pointers that store the address of a function and can be used to dynamically invoke functions during program execution. They are especially useful for implementing callbacks, managing event-driven programming, and passing functions as arguments. To declare a function pointer, you specify the function's return type and its parameters, for example, int (*fp)(int, int) for a pointer that can refer to functions returning an int and accepting two ints as parameters. Function pointers provide flexibility by allowing functions to be called indirectly and passed around within the code, enhancing modularity and adaptability.
