# C - Recursion
Recursion in C is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve problems by breaking them down into simpler, similar sub-problems. It is commonly used for tasks like sorting, calculating factorials, or navigating trees. Recursive functions must have a termination condition to prevent infinite recursion and potential stack overflow errors. This approach allows for cleaner and more concise code for complex problems that are difficult to tackle iteratively.
